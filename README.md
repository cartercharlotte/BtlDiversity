# Btl Protein Diversity
This repository contains the scripts `BtlRVDFinder.R` and `BtlPhylogeneticVisualization.R` that were used in the following study to investigate the diversity of Burkholderia TAL-like (Btl) proteins in endofungal bacteria, namely Mycetohabitans spp.

### Btl Motif Calling and Naming
The `BtlRVDFinder.R` script takes a fasta file of amino acids sequences that are putative Btl proteins as input. It identifies key motifs and extracts the RVD sequences. Based on the presence or absence of motifs, it determines whether the protein is incomplete and gives it a name. The output files are fasta files of amino acid sequences with new names, a limited set of only complete proteins, and RVD sequences. There is also a table containing information about the motifs (`Btl_info.csv`) that was then further modified by hand to contain the sequence sources and make changes to the names after manual curation (`Btl_info_mod.csv`).


### Phylogenetic Tree Visualization
The `BtlPhylogeneticVisualization.R` script takes newick tree files generated by phylogenetic analysis, along with `Btl_info_mod.csv` and plots the trees with extensive annotations added in based on Btl protein motifs, source, and species.
